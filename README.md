This repository contains a simple Python code example demonstrating a common yet easily missed error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code.  The solution, `bugSolution.py`, demonstrates the correct syntax.  This example highlights the importance of careful code review and the use of a good IDE or linter to catch such syntax errors early.
